this package if you start a new project. 

If you want to start a new project with TerrainComposer and use all the saves you made, you can export the TerrainComposer
folder to a package and import it into your new project.

*** DUE TO ASSET STORE REQUIREMENTS AND TERRAINS MENU REMOVED IN UNITY 4.2, TERRAINCOMPOSER IS NOW IN THE UNITY MENU -> WINDOW ***
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TerrainComposer version 1.96
----------------------------------
** Please read the Upgrade Guide in the TerrainComposer manual on page 8.

Fixes:
- Warnings in the runtime terrain script.
- Multi terrain tiles Terrain.Setneighbors seams in runtime/editor.


TerrainComposer version 1.95
----------------------------------

Features:
- Infinite terrains at runtime. Terrains can be generated around the camera with the updated RuntimeTerrains script.
  See TerrainComposer/Runtime/ReadMe.
- New mobile terrain shaders with splat normal textures for 4 and 6 splat textures.

Fixes:
- Auto search for WorldComposer images works now correctly again. WC's tiling system has been changed to TerrainComposer/WorldMachine tiling.
  Images need to be reexported from WC. For shadow removal images this is not needed, only need to click the 'Slice' button again.
- Edge blur for images is working again.



TerrainComposer version 1.92
----------------------------------

Improvements:
- Generated objects can now rotate towards a target. It's in object layer -> object -> transform -> 'Look at Object'.
- Generated objects can now include their scale. It's in object layer -> object -> transform -> 'Include Object scale'.

Fixes:
- Splat custom gave error when changing assigned splat textures on a terrain.
- Generating Raw heightmap could give spikes.
- Generating heightmap masks were applied twice (change in terrain height).



TerrainComposer version 1.9
----------------------------------

Features:
- Export Unity terrains to Obj mesh. 
- Mobile terrain shaders for Unity >4.5, have to import the MobileTerrainShaders package in the TerrainComposer/MobileShaders folder.
- Min-max sliders for color output.

Improvements:
- Position seed can be disabled for each layer to get more randomized placement. Default value can be set in TC Menu -> Options ->
  Generate Settings.
- Export splatmap image import settings are set to true color and wrap mode to clamp.

Fixes:
- Image effects in the manual were showing incorrectly.
- Refresh raw files was not working.



TerrainComposer version 1.8
----------------------------------

Features:
- Min-max sliders for layers. This gives precise control over painting/placement. Can choose this or the old slider system with 'Slider Mode' 
  in each layer.
- Custom splat textures. In each splat layer you can customize each splat texture by blending them together. To enable this unfold a splat
  texture, and enable 'Custom'.
- In splat layer can now use input 'Splatmap' in filters and masks. Using this can improve the workflow, as it takes the splatmap result of
  the layers above it.
- Filter/Mask input 'Splatmap' now has position slider to control the painted splat amount for it to give result 1. E.g. Increasing the slider 
  will paint/place less.
- Rotation of perlin noise in filters/masks. 

Improvements:
- The TerrainComposer folder can now be moved inside the project into another folder.
- Auto generate speed based on framerate is now the only speed option. The auto button is now to enable/disable auto generate.
- Objects are placed within terrain/mesh bounds (do to random position they sometimes moved outside).
- Export button is disabled when switching from color output to another output.
- Example Package download link added in 'Start Window.
- LayerGroup active button and fold out/in only works on layers that have output that is currently active.
- Measure tool window now closes when deactivating measure tool.

Fixes:
- Unity5 WebGL error fix when trying to make a build.
- Unity5.0.1 patch gizmos error fix.
- Unity5.0.1 patch and Unity5.1 beta alphamapTexture fix.
- Tree color now are correct when using Advanced Foliage Shaders.
- Automatic sorting of layers now works correctly.
- Object rotation snapping in object layer.
- Prefab link error in object layer when GameObject is not from project.
- Tree color layer layout.



TerrainComposer version 1.72
----------------------------------

Fixes:
- Terrain size changed when changing the heightmap resolution.
- Smooth tool worked on only 1 terrain.



TerrainComposer version 1.7
----------------------------------
** Please read the Upgrade Guide in the TerrainComposer manual on page 8.

Features:
- Non square terrain support. Now you can choose x and y amount of terrain tiles.
- Unity 5 random tree rotation.
- Change the seed for random placement.


Improvements:
- Unity 5 Ready, does not need the Api Updater anymore.
- Examples package is compatible with Unity 5 (please redownload, as it is another package for Unity5).
- Improved terrain search feature, can search inside parent GameObjects now.
- Improved and simplified GUI.
- Invalid inputs removed from heightmap filter/mask.
- Undo optional in Generate Settings. Unity can get slow with Undo enabled, since TC buttons are protected anyways you can disable this option.
- When changing layer ouput in layer, main output automatically changes to selected output.
- Tree and object placed counters are now inside the tree/object preview button.


Fixes:
- Splat generate error when not shift click <Set All> in TC terrain list -> splat Textures tab.
- Grass generate error when on some ocasions when changing filter output.



TerrainComposer version 1.52
----------------------------------

Features:
- Directly place objects on meshes. Can enable/disable this feature in TC Menu -> Options -> Generate Settings -> 'Generate on Meshes'. 
See page 25 in the updated TerrainComposer manual on how to use it.

Fixes:
_ Unity 5 compile error.
- Removed build error on making builds for Windows Phone 8.


TerrainComposer version 1.47
----------------------------------

Features:
- Non overlap for tree/grass and object layers. If this option is enabled in a layer and the layer places something, it will skip
the rest of the layers for that position. So this prevents overlapping trees, objects, etc.
- Runtime terrains creation script. It is located in TerrainComposer/Runtime folder. Read the ReadMe file there for more information.

Improvements:
- Splat total values that are higher than 1 will be automatically normalized, since a splat total >1 gives overbrighting on Unity
terrain shader. Splatmaps from WorldMachine don't have to be normalized anymore.
- Placed objects are enabled at the end of generating, which makes object placement at least 200% faster.
- Renamed detail to grass. Unity calls grass 'Detail' as there can also be meshes placed etc. But for newcomers it might be confusing
what detail is for, so grass is easier to understand.

Fixes:
- Unity 4.5 serialization errors. Had to move animation curve of color range class 1 depth lower, so in existing projects if the
curve was altered it will be on default again. There is no other way around this.


TerrainComposer version 1.42
----------------------------------

Improvements:
- Exported colormaps now use alpha channel, this can be used in RTP3.1 to display holes in the terrain.
- Export splatmaps directly from the TerrainData's instead of generating them from splat layers.
- Can change the TerrainData for Terrain instances, this is not possible in the Unity editor script, only the terrainCollider can be
changed, which can be confused with the TerrainData. The TerrainData can be set in TC terrain list -> Settings -> TerrainData 
('Show' will show the TerrainData's next to each terrain).
- The total amount of trees placed show under the terrains list when Tree Output is active.	


Fixes:
- Global normal map shows now in RTP3.1.
- Island example automatically loading of heightmap and assigning splat textures.


TerrainComposer version 1.39
----------------------------------

Fixes:
- TerrainComposer window sometimes doesn't open.


TerrainComposer version 1.35
----------------------------------

Improvements:
- Generating from raw heightmap with interpolation. This fixes the blockiness when heightmap does not exactly fit the terrain 
  heightmap resolution.

Fixes:
- Smooth Tool, smoothing terrain edges stay fitted.


TerrainComposer version 1.32
----------------------------------

Improvements:
- Diffuse textures in example pack have now specularity in the alpha channel.
- Splat texture example preset included now normal and heightmap textures for RTP.

Fixes:
- Duplicating filters/masks with the same raw heightmap.
- Deleting filter0 gave out of range.
- Create parent in object in object layer.


TerrainComposer version 1.31
----------------------------------

Improvements:
- Getting Started manual is pdf now obsolete, and only contains contact information as everything is in the main manual now.
- Load Terrain Data option in Generate Settings, to load terrain list from saved TC Project. 

Fixes:
- Image filter tool black screen when background color wasn't activated.


TerrainComposer version 1.3
----------------------------------

Features:
- New Example Wizard Window with 5 included projects. Create a complete terrain Scene with 3 clicks.
- New image filter tool interface with auto generate (shift click generate texture to enable/disable).
- New Convert terrain to mesh in quick tools. Can only do 33, 65 and 129 heightmap resolution at the moment.
- New Lights Setup in quick tools to quickly access all lighting influencing parameters at once.
- Export multi terrain tiles heightmap as 1 combined raw file.
- Added min/max height and steepness to measure tool.
- Auto search formats can be saved and selected now.
- Scale curve in Transform in object layer.

Improvements:
- Subfilters are now called 'Masks'in new projects.
- Removed equal density resolution. Now the tree and object resolution have to be set in local area.
- A filter strength no longer influences tree/grass/object density. 
- Improved smooth tool.
- Color scheme and tooltip text settings is stored globaly now.
- Procedural random generation always generates the same random based on world coordinates.
- Removed TriPlanar shader, because it is outdated and doesn't work with DX11 in Unity 4.
- Heightmap default filter doesn't have a perlin curve now.
- Colormap export resolution is not depending on splat resolution anymore. Can be set now in TC Terrain List -> Local Area.
- Raycast inside a tree to get precise raycasting when random position is enabled.

Fixes:
- Box drawing in TC Menu -> View -> Box.
- Image import max settings in image settings in filters and subfilters.
- Single raw heightmap export flipped axis.
- Auto smooth in heightmap layer.


TerrainComposer version 1.24
----------------------------------

Features:
- Convert meshes to Unity terrain using raycasting in filter. 

Fixes:
- Subfilter input raw heightmap fix.


TerrainComposer version 1.23
----------------------------------

Fixes:
- Generating works in Unity 4.3 now.
- Undo compiling warnings in Unity 4.3.
- RTP Auto assigning colormaps and normals maps window fix.


TerrainComposer version 1.22
----------------------------------

Improvements:
- Spere casting to make ray casting more accurate.

Fixes:
- <Set> and <Set All> in splat texture assignment, was expecting RTP to be there.


TerrainComposer version 1.21
----------------------------------

Features:
- More intergration with RTPv3. Embedded splat/normal/height textures from RTP. Added global normalmap auto search. Save/Load complete RTPv3 presets to prefabs.
- Save/Load/Add terrain presets for splat textures,trees and grass.
- Measure tool has measure distance function for terrain. Click in the measure tool window then go over the terrain in the Scene view,
  press 'M' key to start measuring, press 'M' again to stop. 
- Use terrain splatmap directly as input for filters and subfilters. For example can use this to place only grass and trees on green splat texture.
- Use ray casting in subfilters as input. For example can use this to exclude placing grass on a road. The road need of course needs a collider then.
- Added raw heightmap in subfilters. You can use this as a mask in a heightmap layer. This is more precise as an image and recommended to use instead 
  for heightmaps.
- Combine filter values. To enable enable combine toggle behind filter output. For example you can use this in a splat filter to combine a height and steepness
  filter values into 1 splat texture draw.   


Fixes:
- Export colormap and splatmap.
- Tree distance and distance check. 
- Default balck background color disabled because of Unity free font is also black and cannot be changed.


TerrainComposer version 1.15
----------------------------------

Features:
- Trees Export/Import to treemap prefab. To export click the Tree Output button and then the Export Button. To import go to Quick Tools -> Tree Maps, just drag 
  and drop the saved tree prefab in there. The tree prototype, density and scale for each saved tree prototype can be changed. The generate button has to be 
  clicked with tree output active to load the maps. Tree layers can be added on top. Can import multiple treemaps.
- Grass Export/Import to grassmap prefab. To export click the Grass Output button and then the Export Button. To import go to Quick Tools -> Grass Maps, just drag 
  and drop the saved grass prefab in there. The grass prototype, density for each saved grass prototype can be changed. The generate button has to be clicked
  with grass output active to load the maps. Grass layers can be added on top. Can import multiple grassmaps.

Improvements:
- Can now add detail meshes in terrain grass and use in a layer. To activate enable mesh toggle next to grass texture.
- 'Get All' buttons for size, resolution, splat textures, trees and grass in terrain list. This will get those settings from all terrains.
 

TerrainComposer version 1.14
----------------------------------

Features:
- Objects in object output can be instantiated as prefabs now.

Improvements:
- View only layers for selected output buttons. This is active on default now, can be switched off in TC Menu -> View -> Output Layers Only.
- Auto save global settings with timer, instead of on each lost focus window. Default is 5 minutes, can be changed in TC Menu -> Options -> Generate Settings.

Fixes:
- Grass layer, generate loop error.
- Non square heightmap y not seamless.


TerrainComposer version 1.12
----------------------------------

Fixes:
- Image assigning in filters and subfilters.
- Image importing settings changes from filter and subfilters.


TerrainComposer version 1.11
----------------------------------

Features: 
- Embedded assigning RTP Relief Terrain Pack shader. RTP is displayed under 'Splat Textures' in the terrain list. For it to work you need to have RTP.
  Shift click <RTP> to automatically assign the ReliefTerrain script to every terrain. The colormap of RTP will show, and can be selected with 
  auto search. For many terrain tiles it saves you tons of time assigning.

Improvements:
- Memory optimalization with loading texture list in filters. Texture can now only be loaded on generation, instead of loading every texture into memory. To use this to auto
  search has to be set right and 'Load on generate' should be enabled after selected the texture. 'Load on generate' disables automatically after selecting, because on enabling
  it will automatically set all the import settings for the textures to read/write so the TC can read from them. 
- Heightmap export displays 1 single file now, a number is added to the end of each terrain on exporting.
- Background color can be disabled.


Fixes:
- Video of creating terrain on Youtube was blurry, added new video and changed the link.
- Saving of global settings. 
- Heigthmap export.
- Assigning heightmap in terrain list.

- Works directly in Web Player mode now.
- Works with WorldComposer.
- Can directly import splat maps from example WorldMachine in filters now, enable it with the toggle 'Splatmap' which is the image settings (filter input has to be on image). 
  The first 4 splats detail textures in the splat layer will be selected. 
- Raw files can have non-square resolution now.
- Auto frame generating speed, is displayed next to the generate button. The Unity Editor doesn't drop below this framerate while generating. You can switch between 
  auto speed and manual speed by click the 'Auto' button.
- Use TC project as a prefab, so you can share the project with multiple Scenes, can be activated/deactived in TC Menu -> Generate Settings -> Project Prefab Mode.
- Embedded TriPlanar shader (Optional). In TC Terrain List -> Splat Textures -> <TriPlanar>.
- Colormap option for standard Unity Terrain Shader. Activate/Deactivate by shift clicking <Colormap> in TC Terrain List -> Splat Textures.
- Global Parameters in Quick Tools for changing Heights and Steepness intput. Here you also can choose to stitch heightmap and splatmap automatically after generating.

Improvements:
- For Unity 4.x added material and normal maps in TC Terrain List -> Splat Textures. To benefit from TC multi terrain editing.
- Create a parent for terrains and object in the object layer automatically with the 'create' button.
- Detail Resolution in TC Terrain List can be typed manually, because detail resolution doesn't have to be power of 2.
- Copy terrain material to multi terrains in Unity4 (optional).
- Help button 'H' for curves. Will open a new window with the image of the curve with input on horizontal axis and output on vertical axis.
- Default perlin option in the 'Curve' button -> Line -> Default Perlin. Choosing this will set default perlin curve.
- Colormap splat textures for colormap creation are assigned automatically.
- Optimalization of memory usage.

GUI:
